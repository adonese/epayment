# Cash chain
_Bear in mind this is a work in-progress. I will keep this repo updated_.

One of the main issues we aim to solve is to secure the _cash chain_. This is why the government is heavily investing in epayment. As service providers, we gain our money by taking a small amount of the cash flow we're, well, securing.

## Why this is important and how it's relevant to our case -- how banks work?
You put your money into a bank, hopefully lots of you do. The bank then use these resources to funding other projects (e.g., microfinance). The bank, again hopefully, makes some revenue and all of our money is secured. The whole idea is that, while you put your money at a bank, it is highly unlikely you'd take the next day. It will stay still there for awhile which will allow the bank to use it. In  all of these cases I assumed we were using cash. What's happening now is that, the cash is in people's pockets and not the central bank.
_Now, imagine that our whole money, every fortune we have, is all stored in a centralized network, where _you_ can access them at anytime; the financial institutions where you save your money can also use them too; the central bank can use it in any state backed projects_. This is what we are eventually seeking to achieve. And this is actually how money works too. These papers are more or less represents a claim that you have this amout of fortune (and that the country also have its equivalent of e.g., gold).

With the arrive of new technologies, people have moved from bank accounts to electronic payment. And we here in Sudan are starting too.

## Electronic payment
Now, lets put those theories into practice. We have a national switch hosted and operated by EBS. It is connected to *all* banks. In essence, it has control of _all_ of the cash in the financial institutions. So, our problems are solved and clearly there's no reason writing this article, isn't it? Well not really. Very small amount of Sudanese have banks accounts. People are extensively using cash. Do we need to _first_ make a transfer into a banking system and then later makes the jump into the electronic one. Well, nah. There might be solution for that. We will get to this point later.
- tele corporates held lots of the cash mass (hence the controversial law of limiting the maximum amount of transactions per day)
- Mining markets
- Electricity
- Gas stations
We can assume that a high percentage of the cash is around these businesses, so we can start off there.
