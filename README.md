# State of epayment in Sudan

I'll use this repo to jot down my ideas about epayment; what went wrong and how can we fix it. I'm clearly thinking of EBS v2.0, or what I call "Beyond 1SDG transaction fees and towards new markets". Will be very controversial but someone has to do it anyway.

## The topics i'm going to discuss (nonchronically)
- cash chain
- current players
- EBS
- technical burden
